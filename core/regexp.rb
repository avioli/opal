# A `Regexp` holds a regular expression, that can be used to match
# against strings. Regexps may be created as literals, or using the
# {Regexp.new} method:
#
#     /abc/                 # => /abc/
#     Regexp.new '[a-z]'    # => /[a-z]/
#
# Implementation details
# ----------------------
#
# Instances of {Regexp} are toll-free bridged to native javascript
# regular expressions. This means that javascript regexp instances may
# be passed directly into ruby methods that expect a regexp instance.
#
# Due to the limitations of some browser engines, regexps from ruby are
# not always compatible with the target browser javascript engine.
# Compatibility differences change between engines, so reading up on a
# particular browsers documentation might point to differences
# discovered. The majority of regexp syntax is typically the same.
